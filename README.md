# STM32F103_SineWave_ADC_DMA_Ex03
Generating of a sinusoidal signal using PWM as a DAC, in parallel with ADC conversions., and in the last a UART transfer when triggered..

In this tutorial iÂ´m going to show an application where the STM32F103 (blue pill) communicates with the PC Software Labview, using the serial port UART. 

The code burned in STM32 generates a sinusoidal signal at A0 port, and, at the same time, read the ADC port A1. These reads are buffered of 128 positions. 

When a string "next" is send by Labview and received by STM32, all the buffer, with the last 128 ADC conversions, is send from STM32 to Labview by serial port UART.
